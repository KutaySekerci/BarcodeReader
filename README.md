This project creates a Python code that allows real-time image processing with the Zbar library. When the program is run, 2 different tabs open. The first tab detects the barcode or QR code in the image taken from the Webcam using Zbar, interprets it and prints the result to the terminal. The second tab is a barcode recognition algorithm that I created without using a library, detects the barcode on the screen and displays it with a rectangle.
